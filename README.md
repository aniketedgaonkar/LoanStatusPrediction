## Technologies Used:-
Python and Python Libraries: For model creation and prediction.<br>
Data Sources: Utilized heart data from Excel file to derive meaningful insights.
## Project Insights 
This project focuses on predicting loan approval status based on applicant data. The analysis includes data visualization techniques such as histograms, box plots, and confusion matrices to understand the dataset and evaluate model performance. The XGBoost Classifier was implemented to achieve accurate predictions for loan status classification.
